    <h2>My overall experience of the course.</h2>
    <p>The content and objects of the course was appropriate for us in my opinion. Despite having difficulties, I learned a lot of informations, I must say.
    </p>
    <h2>Where I felt easy during the course:</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>The first exercise was fairly easy. Coding conventions was not a new topic but still learned some more during this course.</li>
    	<li>RWD was new to me and I grabbed a lot here. Learning media queries and making pages responsive was fun.</li>
    	<li>Even though I did not know how to add audio and videos in webpages, it was really easy after googling for a while.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where I trembled during the course:</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>From exercise three, tasks became somewhat difficult. Working with websockets was really new and tedious task to make that work. But I managed to got that working. :)</li>
    	<li>Even though we had studied canvas in our first year in school, it was still difficult to make the game work.Hence, I only managed to complete drawing task.</li>
    	<li>The very last task was fairly difficult because we had to make AJAX call and retrieve data from server. I was also working with APIs in another course, so I made the search from Flickr API work properly.</li>
    </ul>
