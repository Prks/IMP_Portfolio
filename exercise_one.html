  <h1>1. Definitions</h1>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank"> HTML</a></h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. It is a language that is used to produce web pages and is transferred mostly by HTTP protocol. HTML contents are interpreted and formatting is rendered by web browsers in most of the cases. HTML is nothing more than plain language with some formatting and features.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank"> CSS</a></h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It works hand in hands with HTML to make the webpage contents colorful and more formatted. We can color contents, background colors and format a block of text to have one background and the other to have different background for example.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank"> JavaScript</a></h2>
    <p>In order to make the webpage interaction with the user more involving and to render contents dynamically, we can use JavaScript. JavaScript can change contents on the fly. HTML and CSS alone cannot do that. We can show a message only if the user clicks on an object using JavaScript for example. More dynamic pages can be made using JavaScript.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">HTTP</a></h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol. It is a plain text protocol which is used to transfer HTML webpages. HTTP uses port 80 by default in TCP/IP connection.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5</a></h2>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML to this date. It is more feature-rich version of HTML with some extensive features like the option to use or not use quotes in element names.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML" target="_blank"> Dynamic HTML</a></h2>
    <p>Dynamic HTML is collection of Static languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With the proper combination of all those static languages, a dynamic webpage can be created. For example, with the help of javascript we can check inputs in a form without reloading the page and even without connecting to the server. This makes the user experience way easier. </p>
<h1>2. Coding Conventions</h1>
    <p>Codes are what make programs and programs are what enable us to do all possible tasks with machines. We are made up of billions of number of cells in the same way programs are written in thousands of lines. We need clean and healthy cells for us to be healthy as a being in the same way programs need well structured and well organized lines of codes to be a solid program. This is where "Coding Convention comes in".Coding conventions are set of rules made for writing codes easier and understanding written codes convenient.<br>
  Some very important reasons to follow coding conventions are:<br>
</p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Easy to understand</h3>
        <p>They make written codes easy to understand even when we are skimming. Coding conventions make us write our codes structurally and with some pattern.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Uniformity</h3>
        <p>They give uniformity in structures. We use the same structure for same pattern. For example: if we     write functions like this:<br> function greet("name"){ <br>
        document.write("Hello "+ name);<br>
        } <br><br>
        We always write functions like that throughout the code. Not writing like this in another page:<br>

        function greet("name"){ document.write("Hello " + name);}<br>
        But both are perfectly valid for machines.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Development and Maintenance</h3>
      Nobody develops and maintains a huge code all alone. In order for the code to be easy to understand for other collaborators it is essential to use coding convention. In addition to that, when the code has to modified years later, use of coding convention makes it really easy. 
      </li>
    </ol></p> 

<h1>5. Dynamic HTML</h1>
  <h1>Here you can write names using JavaScript</h1>
  Name to add:
  <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Write name here">
  <button onclick="printName();">Submit</button>
<p>Names: </p>
<div id="after">
  <!-- name gets written here-->
</div>

</div>

</body>
